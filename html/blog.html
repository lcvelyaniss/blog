                <h2>About </h2>
                <p>The fig tree is a metaphor from a book called "The bell jar". For me it represents all the things I want to achieve one day, all my dreams and all my memories too.
                    <br> <br>
                    I am an ordinary girl who just want to write something, anything really. Writing about something completely consumes me and it makes me forget everything else. I want to be remembered as who I was through my work and through my words written on pages. 
                    <br><br>
                    On this website I'll be talking about poetry, fashion, dreams and aspects of life. I want to write here whatever is on my heart, hoping you will get the message I want to tell you. My goal here is to make people feel understanded through my poetry and for them to meet others who think like them. 
                    <br><br>
                    I never seem to find any blogs nowadays, especially some like mine. I found blogs only about fashion or healthy lifestyles, but I could never get into the shoes of the writer. I could never sence any personality from their blogs, the only thing I saw were blankly written words with no explanation why the writer wrote them. On my blog I want you to understand me and to look at world through my eyes.
